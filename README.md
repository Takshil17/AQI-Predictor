The AQI Predictor is a machine learning-based model designed to predict Air Quality Index (AQI) levels for Pune. This tool leverages historical AQI data to provide accurate predictions, helping users anticipate air quality trends and make informed decisions.

Key Features

Data-Driven Predictions: The model uses historical AQI data to predict future air quality levels.
5-Day Averaging: The algorithm calculates a rolling average of the AQI over the past 5 days to ensure predictions are based on consistent trends.
Date-Specific Predictions: Users can input a desired date to receive AQI predictions for that specific day.
Data Storage: Historical AQI data is stored and updated regularly to enhance the model's accuracy and reliability.

How It Works
Data Collection: The model uses previously recorded AQI data for analysis. This data is stored in a structured format (e.g., a database or CSV file).
Data Processing: For each prediction, the model calculates the average AQI of the previous 5 days. This average serves as the baseline for predicting AQI levels for the required date.
Prediction Generation: Based on the processed data, the model applies statistical or machine learning algorithms to forecast AQI levels for the input date.
Output: The predicted AQI level is displayed, allowing users to take preventive measures if needed.
